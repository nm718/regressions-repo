Code for various types of regressions

The first regression is a linear type in which I used matrix algebra to compute the appropriate coefficients. 
The second regression is a robust type which employs the Theil-Sen estimator.

I used these regressions in some different ways including modeling the deviations from the regression line and also building a filtering technique for weakly stationary data. 

Please email me any feedback including other regressions to try out, how to optimize my code, and other suggestions.
